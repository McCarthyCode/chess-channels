# Chess Server Using Channels [![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This is a minimalistic chess server, like a stripped down [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/). It is modeled after an example chat server from the [Django Channels Tutorial](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html). As it stands, users may enter a room and chat with another spectators. Soon, the first two players to enter a room will be matched together, and eventually, they will be able to play a game of chess together. If a player leaves, the remaining player will be matched with the first spectator in the queue.
